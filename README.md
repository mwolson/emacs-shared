Shared Emacs settings
=====================

This is an Emacs starter kit with:

- **Modern editor features**: Autocomplete, entire project search and replace, find definition
- **Cross-platform support**: Tested on Linux, Windows, and macOS
- **Fullscreen by default**, with a gap left for the Dock on macOS
- **Dark color theme**, additionally with the [spaceline](https://github.com/TheBB/spaceline) theme for the mode-line
- Extensive **setup instructions**
- **Splash screen** appears while starting Emacs, and startup is optimally fast
- **Manuals** are pre-built and show up when you do `C-h i`

Differences from other Emacs starter kits:

- Principle of least surprise is a design goal
- Augments your existing `~/.emacs.d/init.el` file instead of replacing it
- Can be personalized with a single `setq` statement
