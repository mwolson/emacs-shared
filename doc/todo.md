To Do
-----

- Document each of the individual shared-emacs options in code and possibly on a wiki page
- List each Emacs add-on we use and/or bundle
- Finish uploading my scripts to manage Emacs as a daemon
- Include various Emacs registry hacks for Windows (like Edit with Emacs)
- Decide whether to document the `ALTERNATE_EDITOR` environment variable on Windows; may be useful for those who want
  to make view source or double-click on various file types open up in an existing Emacs frame
- Document how to remap Caps Lock to Control (recommended as it can be more ergonomic)
