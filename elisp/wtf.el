;;; Commentary:

;; Thanks to Trent Buck for `emacs-wiki-wtf.el', which inspired the
;; creation of `wtf.el'.

;; Use:
;;
;; To use this, go to an unknown term in a buffer and type M-x wtf-is.
;; This can also be done programmatically.

;; Legalese:
;;
;; The terms were downloaded from
;; http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/share/misc/.  No copyright
;; notice was included, but the intent of the original author was to
;; put these terms in the public domain.  This was deduced from
;; several emails sent to the authors of these files.  Additionally,
;; the original data files use a specific syntax which does not allow
;; for a copyright notice.
;;
;; The original program that uses these files in NetBSD
;; (http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/games/wtf/wtf) is in the
;; public domain.
